## Wordle: user stories

As a user, I want to:

- Navigate to the Wordle website and see a blank 5 x 6 grid and a set of letter tiles

- **Click on a letter tile and see it appear on the grid. The placing of the tile should depend on whether I have previously clicked different letter tiles**

- Press “backspace” to remove a letter tile from the grid

- Press “enter” when I have filled an entire grid row with letter tiles

- See "Error" message appear if I press "enter" with less than five tiles 

- See "Error" message appear if I press "enter" with an invalid word

- See letters change colour on grid and on the set of letter tiles depending on “goal” word
    - Grey (incorrect)  
    - Yellow (correct wrong position) 
    - Green (correct right position) 

- When correct, see all the grid letter tiles appear green after pressing "enter"

- See a “splendid” message appear briefly before automatically displaying user statistics

- Have six attempts (previous attempts are displayed on the grid) 

- See a "defeated" message after six unsuccessful attempts
