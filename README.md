## Wordle: user stories

- As a user I want to navigate to Wordle website and see a blank 5 x 6 grid and a set of letter tiles

- *As a user I want to click on a letter tile and see it appear on the grid (placing and order depends on whether I have previously clicked (a) different letter tile(s))*

- As a user I want to press “backspace” to remove a letter from the tile.

- As a user I want to press “enter” when I have filled five tiles with letters

- "Error" message will appear if they input less than five tiles or an invalid word

- Letters change colour on grid and on letter selection depending on “goal” word
    - Grey (incorrect)  
    - Yellow (correct wrong position) 
    - Green (correct right position) 

- When correct, I want to see all the grid letter tiles appear green after pressing "enter"

- A “splendid” message appears briefly before automatically displaying user statistics.

- As a user I want to have six attempts (previous attempts are displayed on the grid) and if unsuccessful see a "defeated" message
